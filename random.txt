-------------------------------------------
This is a fantastic concept. The "Vibe Building" sketches are actually very clear wireframes—you have a solid foundation here. The idea of "Cyan blocks," "Tetris-style loading," and "Building at the speed of thought" gives us a very specific aesthetic: Cyber-Industrial & Constructivist.
Since you are handling the frontend, I will break this down into a Design Concept, UI Components, and Frontend Implementation Strategy so you can start coding this immediately.
The Design Concept: "The Digital Forge"
We want to move away from generic SaaS designs and lean into the "Builder/Maker" vibe.
 * Color Palette: Based on your notes.
   * Background: Deep Charcoal or Matte Black (allows the 3D model to pop).
   * Primary Accent: Electric Cyan (The "Forge" energy).
   * Secondary Accent: Warm Amber or Hot Pink (for the "heat" of the forge/active states).
 * Typography:
   * Headlines: Wide, bold Sans-serif (e.g., Satoshi or Inter Tight).
   * UI/Input: Monospace (e.g., JetBrains Mono or Roboto Mono) to emphasize the "coding/prompting" aspect.
The Hero Section Layout
Based on your sketch, here is a structured proposal for the Hero Section.
1. The Composition (Split Layout)
 * Left Side (The Input): Headline, Value Prop, and the massive Prompt Interface.
 * Right Side (The Result): The interactive 3D Keycap viewer floating in space.
2. The Elements
A. The Headline
 * Text: "Build at the speed of thought." (From your sketch—it's a great tagline).
 * Subtext: "Turn text prompts into custom mechanical keycaps. Designed by AI, forged in 3D, shipped to your door."
B. The "Magic" Input Bar (The Core Feature)
Your sketch shows a box saying "I want to build...". Let's elevate this.
 * Visual: A large, pill-shaped or rectangular input field with a heavy Cyan border.
 * Placeholder Text: Typing animation effect: "I want a keycap that looks like a cyberpunk samurai helmet..."
 * The Button: A "Generate" button inside the bar. When clicked, it shouldn't just click—it should glow or "ignite."
C. The 3D Stage (Right Side)
 * Idle State: A blank, generic keycap rotating slowly. Wireframe mode or semi-transparent glass texture.
 * The "Floating" Effect: Use a subtle bobbing animation (Sine wave on the Y-axis).
D. The Loading State (Your "Tetris" Idea)
 * This is the "Wow" factor. When the user hits "Generate":
   * The 3D keycap on the right dissolves into the "Cyan Blocks" you sketched.
   * These blocks fall from the top of the container (Tetris style) and stack up.
   * As the backend finishes (approx. 5-10s), the blocks "fuse" together to reveal the generated 3D model.
Frontend Implementation (The "How-To")
Since you are the frontend dev, here is how I would stack this technically to achieve the sketch's vibe.
1. The 3D Viewer (React Three Fiber)
Don't be intimidated by the 3D part. Use React Three Fiber (R3F). It is a React wrapper for Three.js.
 * Setup: You need a <Canvas> component on the right side.
 * Lighting: Use <Stage> from @react-three/drei to get instant, beautiful studio lighting without complex math.
 * The Model: Load a .gltf or .obj file.
2. The "Tetris" Loading Animation
You mentioned "blocks falling like Tetris."
 * Library: Framer Motion is perfect for this.
 * Logic:
   * Create a grid of divs (Cyan blocks) overlaying the 3D canvas.
   * On "Generate" click, trigger a staggerChildren animation where blocks drop in from y: -100.
   * Once the backend returns the model URL, crossfade the blocks out to reveal the 3D model.
3. The "Glassmorphism" UI
To match the "Vibe Building" sketch (specifically the "Props In" box):
 * Give your UI panels (the prompt bar, the properties panel) a glass effect.
 * CSS:
   background: rgba(20, 20, 20, 0.6);
backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
border: 1px solid rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.2); /* Cyan border */
box-shadow: 0 4px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);

Step-by-Step UI Flow (Based on your sketches)
 * State 1: Inspiration (Idle)
   * Hero: "Build at the speed of thought."
   * 3D: A glossy, blank keycap rotates.
   * Input: Empty, pulsing cursor.
 * State 2: The Forge (Loading)
   * User types: "A keycap shaped like a dragon head." & clicks Generate.
   * Action: The input bar locks.
   * Visual: The blank keycap disappears. Cyan blocks rain down (your sketch idea), stacking up in the shape of a cube or rough pyramid. A text overlay says "Forging geometry..."
 * State 3: The Reveal (Success)
   * Visual: The blocks glow white and vanish, revealing the newly generated Dragon Keycap model.
   * UI Update: A new panel slides in (from your "Props In" sketch) allowing them to change material (Resin, PBT) or color.
   * CTA: The button changes from "Generate" to "Add to Cart" or "Refine".
Would you like me to write the React/Tailwind code for the "Input Bar" component or the basic layout structure?
